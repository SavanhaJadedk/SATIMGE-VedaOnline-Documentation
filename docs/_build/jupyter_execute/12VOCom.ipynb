    "The commercial buildings sector in SATIM includes wholesale, retail and motor trade services, warehouses and industrial spaces, office buildings, banking facilities, and other non-residential and government spaces including schools, hospitals, hotels, and recreational facilities. Public sector floor area, which primarily serves public services, includes public lighting and water services is also considered.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial sector energy service demand is estimated based on the energy intensity of energy services required as a function of lettable floor area (PJ/m2) and is linked to growth in floor area and improvements in energy efficiency over time. Final energy demand is internally computed within SATIM, factoring in technology efficiency and penetration within the sector, as the model assumes that energy services in new buildings can be delivered more efficiently with newer technologies, while constraints on residual capacity and building design limit the adoption of newer technologies and other improvements in energy efficiency in older buildings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Energy services are disaggregated into cooling, space heating, cooking, lighting, refrigeration, water heating, public lighting, public water supply, and other appliances. As with the residential sector, end-uses can be represented either by fuel or technology. Technology shares encompass the prevalence, activity levels, and efficiencies of different technology types supplying specific energy services.\n",
